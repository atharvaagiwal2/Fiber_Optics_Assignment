# Fiber_Optics_Assignment

This repository contains the solutions to two problems related to waveguides and optical fibers. The solutions are provided in the form of a Matlab script that generates the required plots and numerical values.

Problem 1:

(a) The Matlab script generates a plot of the transcendental equation for TE modes of a symmetric step-index planar slab waveguide. Both symmetric and anti-symmetric modes are plotted.

(b) The script also derives the relationship between the normalized propagation constant ‘b’ and normalized frequency parameter ‘V’ for TE modes of the waveguide and generates a plot of V-b curve.

Problem 2:

(a) The Matlab script derives the relationship between the normalized propagation constant ‘b’ and normalized frequency parameter ‘V’ for the fundamental HE11 mode (LP01) of a step-index optical fiber and generates a plot of the V-b curve.

(b) The script also plots Vd^2/dV^2 for various V values for the fundamental HE11 mode (LP01) of the SI optical fiber.

Note: The solutions presented here are based on the assumptions and equations provided in the textbook "Fiber Optics and Optoelectronics" by Khare, R.P.
